# Placeholder Images Needed

## Quick Fix: Create Simple Placeholder Images

Since you don't have images yet, you can:

1. **Option 1: Use placeholder.com temporarily**
   - Not recommended for production (security issue)
   - But can be used during development

2. **Option 2: Create solid color placeholder images**
   - Create simple colored JPG files using any image editor
   - Recommended sizes:
     - Hero images: 1920x1080px
     - Gallery images: 800x600px
     - Profile images: 400x400px

3. **Option 3: Use online placeholder generators**
   - https://placeholder.com/
   - Download and save to appropriate folders

## Required Images (Minimum)

For the website to work without errors, you need at least:

- `public/images/hero/hero-main.jpg`
- `public/images/gallery/science_fair.jpg`
- `public/images/gallery/graduation_day.jpg`
- `public/images/gallery/sports_day.jpg`
- `public/images/gallery/cultural_day.jpg`
- `public/images/about/school_building.jpg`
- `public/images/academics/science_lab.jpg`
- `public/images/hero/admission-banner.jpg`
- `public/images/misc/placeholder_profile.jpg`

## Testing Without Images

The website will compile and run, but you'll see 404 errors in the console for missing images. The layout and components will still display correctly.
